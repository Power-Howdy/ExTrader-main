# ExTrader

Our purpose is to replicate the similar application of MT4/MT5 by MetaQuotes.
Meta Trader (MT) is a platform for trading forex that provides easy-to-use apps for the traders (app users).
Every user must register the broker account by oneself on the broker, which uses MT platform beforehand. The login ID and the password are different for every broker.
In order to develop a new application, we intend to use the official API (http://mtapi.online/).
For the user friendliness, the applicaiton must be similar UI as the original one.
